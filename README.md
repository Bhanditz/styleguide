# Europeana Styleguide

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/europeana/styleguide.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/europeana/styleguide)

## Background
Europeana uses Pattern Lab in order to develop its styleguide and maintain its sitesâ€™ stylesheets, javascripts, images and markup templates.  Compass and Php are required to run it.

Styleguide development is done on files within the /source/ directory of this project, focused primarily on the files within the /source/_patterns directory. Site assets are generated by executing 'php core/console --generate'

## Setup

### Without Docker
1. Clone this repo into a working directory
1. Generate and/or update the /source/css/ directory and its css
   1. initially the /source/css directory does not exist
   1. assuming that [compass](http://compass-style.org/install/ "compass install page") has already been installed, from the root of the working directory run `compass compile source/`
1. Make sure you have Composer installed [globally](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx)
1. Run `composer install`
1. Generate and/or update the /public/ directory and its site assets and launch a server
   1. from the root of the working directory run `php core/console --server --with-watch`
   1. the styleguide will now be available at `http://localhost:8080/`
1. The web server should serve files from the `public` directory generated or updated in the previous step


## Development

For more details on Europeana's front-end development practice please see the [development wiki](https://europeana.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EC/pages/172687365/Front-End)


## Additional notes
* Pattern Lab configuration can be adjusted in the /core/config/config.ini.default file.
* If, for any reason, you need to delete all assets from the public directory, you should also delete the /config/config.ini file. The `php core/console --generate` will then re-generate that file and the /public/ directory without error.
* This site: http://styleguide.europeana.eu/ is built from the develop branch

## About Pattern Lab

The PHP version of Pattern Lab is, at its core, a static site generator. It combines platform-agnostic assets, like the [Mustache](http://mustache.github.io/)-based patterns and the JavaScript-based viewer, with a PHP-based "builder" that transforms and dynamically builds the Pattern Lab site. By making it a static site generator, Pattern Lab strongly separates patterns, data, and presentation from build logi.cg
